            Hi there! I'm Yousef, an aspiring electrical engineer with a passion for merging hardware and software to build real solutions. I'm studying at the University of Waterloo, where I actively participate in hands-on projects, research, and extracurricular engineering teams. My special interests include wireless motion detectors, IoT systems, and renewable energy electronics.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am dedicated to continuous learning and enjoy collaborating with diverse teams to turn ideas into working prototypes. My journey so far has given me practical skills in embedded systems, PCB design, and both backend and frontend software development. Outside of technology, I enjoy soccer, drone photography, and volunteering.
